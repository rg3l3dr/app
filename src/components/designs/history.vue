/*
  Deconflate Changes/Versions/Revisions/Commit Messages
    - Different for a project/part/file
    - Mikes notion of bumping revisions on every change
    - Need a notion of an ECO

  What would this tab show?
    - a commit log of every change for the project, who, when, what they did, and a message (if any)
    - some way to filter the log
    - a way to back track or under (like a back button or undo button)
    - a change graph show configs, revs, and changes

  Git analogies
    - git blame and show

  How does this match up with other parts of the app
    - django-activity-stream
    - the commit graph (cal heat map)
